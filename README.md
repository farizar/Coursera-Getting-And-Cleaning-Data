# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject

This repo contains the files for the final project for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera.

The R script will download data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  Consequently it cleans the data and processes it as described in the [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/farizar/GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject/blob/master/CodeBook.md) file. 

Thanks and have a blessed day!  :)
